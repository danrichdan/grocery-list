# grocery-list

A slight variation on a JavaScript Booklist app from a tutorial I watched by Brad Traversy.

That was a booklist, this is just a grocery list with a checkbox mark to mark as needed or not needed.

Has multiple scripts. Each one is a little different, one is with objects and prototypes, another is with Classes, another is with classes and Local Storage, and may make one with objects/prototypes with Local Storage.
